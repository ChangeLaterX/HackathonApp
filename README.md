# RecipeSwipe

**RecipeSwipe** is a mobile iOS app that helps users discover, import, and organize recipes based on what they already have at home and their personal dietary preferences. Built as a hackathon MVP, it leverages a local LLM to scrape public recipe sources and generate customized suggestions, and brings a familiar “swipe to like” interaction to meal planning.

## Key Features

* **User Preferences**
  Specify dietary restrictions, favorite cuisines, disliked ingredients, and overall goals (e.g. weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance).

* **Pantry Inventory**
  Quickly list the ingredients you have on hand—no more wasted groceries or last-minute runs to the store.

* **Tinder-Style Recipe Discovery**
  Swipe right to save a recipe, left to pass. Each card shows an autogenerated recipe name, photo, ingredient list, and preparation instructions.

* **Import & Save Recipes**

  * **URL Import**: Paste a link to any online recipe and have it automatically scraped and stored.
  * **OCR Scanning**: Snap a photo of a handwritten or printed recipe to digitize and save it.
  * **Personal Database**: All saved recipes live in your own app database for easy retrieval and categorization.

* **Automated Meal Planning**
  Generate a weekly meal plan tailored to:

  * Number of meals per day
  * Remaining budget
  * Available pantry ingredients

## Hackathon MVP Scope

For this initial version (the hackathon MVP), we focus on:

1. **Backend**:

   * Core data models: User, Preferences, Pantry, Recipe
   * CRUD endpoints for preferences, pantry, and basic recipe storage
   * Local LLM pipeline for recipe generation from pantry + preferences

2. **Frontend**:

   * User onboarding for preferences and pantry inputs
   * Swipe-based recipe browser
   * Basic recipe detail view and “save” functionality

All other advanced features (budget tracking, full meal-plan customization, multi-language support, etc.) will be scoped for later iterations.
